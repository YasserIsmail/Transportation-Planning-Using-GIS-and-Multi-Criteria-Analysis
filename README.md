# 🚆 Transportation Planning Using GIS and Multi-Criteria Analysis

### 📍 Case Study: Beijing and XiongAn

## 🧭 Overview

This project presents a structured transportation planning analysis using **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** and the **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)**, aimed at identifying the most efficient transport connection between **Beijing** and the newly planned satellite city **XiongAn** in China. The work was conducted as part of a Master's-level assignment and is based on the peer-reviewed article:

> *"Transportation Planning through GIS and Multi-Criteria Analysis: Case Study of Beijing and XiongAn"*

## 🎯 Objectives

* Model and evaluate multiple transport options (railways, highways, metro).
* Apply **GIS-based route analysis** to explore feasible connections.
* Use **AHP** to prioritize transport alternatives based on multiple criteria.
* Support sustainable development and urban planning goals.

## 🧪 Methodology

The study followed a **two-step framework**:

### 1️⃣ GIS-Based Route Identification

* Mapped existing and potential transport corridors using spatial data.
* Assessed road types (motorways, trunk roads, secondary and branch roads).
* Modeled 3 potential highway routes and one new radial railway line.
* Evaluated terrain suitability using LULC, slope, and elevation data.

### 2️⃣ AHP-Based Criteria Prioritization

* Ten criteria were considered:
  `Cost, Travel Time, Infrastructure Type, Connectivity, Comfort, Reliability, Safety, Accessibility, Terminal Type, Environmental Impact`
* Assigned weights using expert judgment and Saaty's pairwise comparison.
* Evaluated 5 transport options:

  * V1: Existing intercity railway
  * V2: Metro + New High-Speed Rail 🚆✅ (Optimal)
  * V3–V5: Variants of highway connections

## 📊 Results

* The **Metro + High-Speed Railway (V2)** scored the highest priority (0.27).
* Key deciding factors: **travel time**, **safety**, **cost**, and **environmental friendliness**.
* Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the chosen alternative.

## 🧩 Tools & Skills Demonstrated

* **ArcGIS Pro / ArcMap** – route and suitability modeling
* **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** – AHP modeling
* **Cartographic Visualization** – network maps, LULC layers, terminal access models
* **Critical evaluation** of transportation and environmental policies

## 📁 File Included

* `Transportation Planning Summary.pdf` – My structured summary and slide-based analysis

## 📌 Academic Context

This project was completed as part of my coursework in the **Master's in Geomatics** program and highlights my ability to combine theoretical research with applied spatial analysis and decision-making techniques.
